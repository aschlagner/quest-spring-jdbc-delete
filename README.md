# SEA8 - Spring JDBC Quest 04 - Delete

## Challenge: Removing a school from the database


*Fork* the following repository: https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/quest-spring-jdbc-delete.

**Note: this repository is NOT the same as the one in the previous quest!**

You are taking over the development of a Harry Potter fan site in order to add functionality. As it stands, the site allows the removal of a character from the wizard universe described in the series.

Luckily, the database is the same as in the previous quest. However, if you have deleted it, you can import the database *spring_jdbc_quest here*.

The user *h4rryp0tt3r* is also the same as in the previous quest with the same password *Horcrux4life* and all possible permissions over the database *spring_jdbc_quest*.

> You should start by testing out the site and seeing how it works.

**Be sure to check out all the classes in the repository before starting the challenge!**

1. Test that the site is working correctly
2. Make it so that it is possible to delete a school on the route: */school/delete*

## Validation criterias

- The project runs well using the required database and user.
- It is possible to delete a school.
- The school no longer appears in the list once it is deleted.
- The *JDBC* code is in a *repository* class and not in a *controller* class.
- JDBC resources are closed properly.
- The code is available on GitHub.
